The unit sets ProtectHome=yes, which makes /home invisible to the service, so this
would install cleanly and then fail to start with status=203/EXEC.

Install the package somewhere the service can see it:

  sudo npm install -g --prefix /usr/local @wundervault/mcp-server
  sudo sh $0 --exec /usr/local/bin/wundervault-agent

ProtectHome is not negotiable here: it is what stops the daemon reading the home
directories of the agents it holds credentials for.

And no, this cannot be solved by bind-mounting the path back in. A directory under your
home is WRITABLE by everything that runs as you, agents included — so the daemon would be
executing code its own agents can replace. That is a worse hole than the one this whole
step exists to close: it would hand over not just the credentials but the process that
guards them. The package has to live somewhere the agent cannot write.
